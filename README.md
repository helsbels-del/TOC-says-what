# TOC Says What
<u>TOC Says What</u> is a machine learning (ML) project aimed at predicitng disinfection byproducts from water quality metric data.
This project uses machine learning to predict THM concentraion from TOC, pH, turbidity, and conductivity, providing indirect insights for chlorine dosing strategies.

## Table of contents






## Dataset Content
I have choosen to use a data set from kaggle - Water Quality Prediction (7 models)
All of the data is public and therefore no privacy or ethical issues have been breached.
It contains 3,276 water samples and 10 variables, with TOC being our target variable.

* Describe your dataset. Choose a dataset of reasonable size to avoid exceeding the repository's maximum size and to have a shorter model training time. If you are doing an image recognition project, we suggest you consider using an image shape that is 100px × 100px or 50px × 50px, to ensure the model meets the performance requirement but is smaller than 100Mb for a smoother push to GitHub. A reasonably sized image set is ~5000 images, but you can choose ~10000 lines for numeric or textual data. 


## Business Requirements
* Describe your business requirements
What are the business requirements?
- The client wants to monitor TOC levels and track fluctuations over a year to help with efficient and effective dosing levels.
- The client wants to be able to predict optimal dosing levels throughout teh year/at anytime.
Is there any business requiremetn that can be answered with conventional data analysis?
  
## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks


## ML Business Case
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualized an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course 


## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).



## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-24](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
